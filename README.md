# CS240 Software Engineering <br>Group Project <br>Spring 2020

A website hosting an educational math game. Users login to their account, and solve math problems of varying complexity to assemble a burger, fries, and milkshake. As the student learns simpler mathmatical concepts like addition and subtraction, the math problems increase in difficulty to concepts like division and multiplication. When a use logs out, their progress is saved. Teachers have special accounts to monitor their students' progress.
